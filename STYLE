Stuff that is not lexical variables
===================================

  *hello*
    Dynamic variables.


  -hello-
    Global variables (AMX:DEFINE-GLOBAL).


  =hello=
    Symbol macros.


  +hello+
    Constant values (ALEXANDRIA:DEFINE-CONSTANT).



Other unusual looking stuff
===========================

Some of these are defined in SW-MVC and SW-STM.


  #~42
    Creates a SW-MVC:CELL with a value 42 in it.


  ~something
    Is short for (DEREF something). It is used for many things:

      * Extracting the value of a SW-MVC:CELL or SW-MVC:FORMULA.
      * Extracting or evaling a AMX:LAZY-VALUE.
      * Extracting the value of a AMX:ATOMT.
      * Extracting the value of a SW-STM:REF.
        ....etc.


  #λ(..)
    Creates a SW-MVC:CELL with a SW-MVC:FORMULA in it. One could
    also say #~λ(..) and it'd mean and do the same thing.


  λ
    Creates a SW-MVC:FORMULA.


  #l
    Creates a AMX:LAZY-VALUE. Use ~ to eval it or "extract its value".
